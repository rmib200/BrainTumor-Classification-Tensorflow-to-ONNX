__Run the Project__ <br> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]( https://colab.research.google.com/github/rmib200/BrainTumor-Classification-Tensorflow-to-ONNX/blob/main/BrainTumor_Tensorflow_Classification_ONNX.ipynb)

This project is aimed to the classification of tumors in human brains ðŸ§  with Tensorflow using a reproducible pipeline and exporting the model using [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) for later testing in a project inside Unity.

The model uses an extremely simple architecture and few learning epochs to achieve a high degree of prediction.

The dataset and the code for the code are available as well as the model in ONNX format.
